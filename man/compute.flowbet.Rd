\title{Compute node flow betweenness from graph or adjacency matrix}
\usage{
compute.flowbet(graph, mode = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{an igraph object (or an adjacency matrix)}

\item{mode}{optional, only if `graph` is an adjacency matrix. Othewise character scalar, specifies how igraph should interpret the supplied matrix. Default here is directed. Possible values are: directed, undirected, upper, lower, max, min, plus. Added vector too. See details \link[igraph]{graph_from_adjacency_matrix}.}
}
\value{
a vector of flow betweenness values for each node
}

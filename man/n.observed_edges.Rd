\title{Get number of edge observations (for group scans with unobservable individuals)
quantify actual edge-wise sampling effort, considering that some weren't observable in all group scans.Internal use.}
\usage{
n.observed_edges(
  scan_list,
  diag = 0,
  use.rare.opti = FALSE,
  obs.prob = NULL,
  n.zeros = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scan_list}{list of binary group scans, with NAs when the dyad was not observable.}

\item{diag}{integer (mostly), value to replace the diagonal of the output matrix with. Use NULL if you consider self-loop (untested).}
}
\value{
a square matrix with element quantifying how many time a dyad has been sampled
}

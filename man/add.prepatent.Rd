\title{Add prepatent period to data table}
\usage{
add.prepatent(DT, mean.lag, duration = 4, extension = 2,
  unit = c("day", "week", "month"))
}
\arguments{
\item{DT}{data table containing at least a date column.}

\item{mean.lag}{time lag substracted from date, in unit.}

\item{duration}{desired duration of the time-window, in unit.}

\item{extension}{bidirectional extension of the time-window, especially for a subsequent random time-window shift.}

\item{unit}{unit in which mean.lag and duration are provided, with the smallest unit considered being days to perform Dates calculations. (EXTEND TO OTHER TIME RESOLUTION LATER?)}
}
\value{
returns the original data table TD after appending to it columns dinf and dsup, representing the boundaries of the small or large time-window (according to extension being zero or not) for each datapoint

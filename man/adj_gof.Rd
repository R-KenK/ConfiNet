\title{Wrapper to calculate goodness of fit (GOF) from adjacency/network distances}
\usage{
adj_gof(Bootstrap.list, method = c("group", "focal"), dist.fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bootstrap.list}{an output of Boot_scan()}

\item{method}{character scalar, indicate if the function should output the GOF between the theoretical adjacency matrix and either the empirical one from group or focal method}

\item{dist.fun}{a matrix/network distance function taking an igraph object (or an adjacency matrix but transforms it to an igraph object first) and returns an ordered vector of vertex centralities}
}
\value{
a vector of GOF values between theoretical and empirical methods.

\title{Sum up and flatten list of binary scans
Internal use. Sum up binary adjacency matrices or focal vectors according to the method used}
\usage{
sum_up.scans(
  Adj,
  scan_list,
  scaled = FALSE,
  keep = FALSE,
  method = c("group", "focal", "both")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Adj}{square integers matrix of occurences of dyads. WIP: implement method for association matrices...}

\item{scan_list}{list of binary adjacency matrices, binary focal vectors, or both, outputed by iterating do.scan()}

\item{scaled}{logical, specifies if adjacency data should be scaled by sampling effort.}

\item{keep}{logical. Relevant if group scans are performed. Indicate if the original "theoretical" group scan should be kept track of.}

\item{method}{Character scalar, specify if the function should use a whole group or a focal scan sampling method (or both).}
}
\value{
A non-binary adjacency matrix, or a list of two if method = "both"
}

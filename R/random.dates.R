# Random dates
#
# Randomly draw dates to bound random time-windows.
#
# @param Obs data.table of dyadic observations. Must contain a date column.
# @param duration desired duration of the time-window, in unit.
# @param extension bidirectional extension of the time-window.
# @param unit unit in duration and extension are provided, with the smallest unit considered being days to perform Dates calculations. (EXTEND TO OTHER TIME RESOLUTION LATER?)
# @param mode type of random draw. So far only "first-half" is implemented: draws an inferior date in the first half of the existing dates, then draw the closest date that is duration+extension (in days) away.
#
# @return Returns a vector of two random (closest) dates from Obs, separated apart from ~duration+extension days.

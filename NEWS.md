# ConfiNet 0.8.1
* Structuring simulation script and proof of concept for multiple parameters testing
* Added proper handling of adjacency mode in the form of adjacency_mode() and binary_adjacency_mode(), included in do.scan() and sum_up.scans()
* Added a wrapper for the frequently used do.call(rbind,lapply()) sequence

# ConfiNet 0.8.0
* Added observable_edge() to subset group scans according to observation probability. Supports probability matrix, vector, or single value.
* Added output="all" option to keep track of both list and adjacency matrix in Boot_scans()
* Updated consequently nested functions
* Added internal function Bootstrap_add.attributes() to store Boot_scans() parameters as attributes in the Bootstrap output
* Added Boot_get.list() function to cleanly retrieve some data of a Boot_scans() output. Relies on the Bootstrap attributes to avoid users inputting them

# ConfiNet 0.7.1
* Added progress bar through pblapply (pbapply package) to Boot_scan()

# ConfiNet 0.7.0
* Implemented focal scan with definable probs by giving output option to do.scan()
* fixed typo in previous NEWS.md
* Added Boot_scan into higher bootstrap function with method option (group or focal scans)

# ConfiNet 0.6.1
* Bug fixes and renaming: scale.to.binary.prob -> Binary.prob, moved simu.scan into .WIP folder
* other minor syntax/bug fixes till build doesn't return any error.

# ConfiNet 0.6.0
* Added focal scan simulation function simu.focal (need cleaning)
* Pre-implementation of user-defined probabilities for simu.scan and simu.focal
* Added option to output either list of scans or weighted adjacency matrix in simu.scan
* implemented scale.to.binary.prob (will haev to rename probably) and do.scan

# ConfiNet 0.5.1
* Added group scan simulation function simu.scan

# ConfiNet 0.5.0
* Change package name KenNet -> ConfiNet + script and function names changes (KenNet -> ConfiNet and KenBoot -> ConfiBoot).

# ConfiNet 0.4.1
* Bug fixes related to Documents and Check

# ConfiNet 0.4.0
* Reading through Whitehead (2008) to implement the different association indices (WIP)...
* Implementing adjacency to association index for the case of focal sampling and egocentric networks

# ConfiNet 0.3.1
* Implemented edge -> adj, probably useful even if only for internal use...

# ConfiNet 0.3.0
* Progress toward bootstrap and network building implementation (still WIP).

# ConfiNet 0.2.0
* Preparations for RTWS algorithm: (rk.)closest.dates, extend.window and random.dates.

# ConfiNet 0.1.3
* Added Adj -> edge list with repetitions representing edge weights.

# ConfiNet 0.1.2
* Added Obs list -> list of subsets to prepare for automatic dynamic SNA.

# ConfiNet 0.1.1
* Formatting everything related to versioning


# ConfiNet 0.1.0
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
